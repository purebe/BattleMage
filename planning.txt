Mission Statement:
    Prevent the arms race.  Mages are NOT immortal.  They are very capable and powerful, but not OVERPOWERED.  Further, they should still fear death.
    The player, even the most advanced mage, should not feel immortal.  There should be ample challenge.  Game play without challenge is BORING.
    Minecraft poses a lot of challenges by default, this mod should make those challenges stand out and provide unique solutions, but not a panacea.
    
    Trade offs are key, donning a wand and a wizard suit should open you up to physical damage, but enhance your offensive and utility capabilities.
    The player must make choices that are not obvious.  A black magi should be feared for his ability to cause untold destruction, but the brighter
    the candle, the faster it burns.  White magi are the greatest of allies, but alone they do not stand.
